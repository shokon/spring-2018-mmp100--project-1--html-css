<p> What makes her intersting is that not that she is a little miscivious with her
housemates. However, she is able to have in interactive chat everytime when she
streams on twitch. Apart from being a Youtuber, she is able to live a basic
normal life even if she gets sick or not. or collabing with another person or
not. She is the most outgoing person that people can relate with. But the one
thing that she is able to do about helping people is a segment on her stream called
Dr.Poki. And this is about her listening to peoples problems and she is able to
help in anyway she can by giving the best advice she can offer to perk up anyones
day. Those are the reasons why she intersting and why she inspire me to have a
future job in the gaming industry, plus she was also to help me with my week of
depression when my first dog died thanks to her Dr.Poki advice.</p>
